Comments: I like that you dont have to us Facebook to log in, I deleted my account. I like the way the app helps you do the tour on your own.

Comments: Joyce is better or easier to understand when performed so to have recordings and youtube videos available is a greath thing to help people understand it. I know in New York they try to have their own version of bloomsday and try to get it going, and people do dress up for it.

Comments: I have visited Dublin twice, and I would have liked to see more places related to joyce, I visited The Dead house on the liffey, and Great Georges Street. The app would be useful if like me you didnt visit on Bloomsday itself and could see events from it on your phone.
